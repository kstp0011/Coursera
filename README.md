# Coursera Study Materials and Projects  

This repository contains my study materials and projects from various Coursera courses.  

Most of these courses were taken through audit mode. To supplement my learning, I utilized labs and assignments from external GitHub repositories. I acknowledge that these materials are used strictly for educational purposes, and I ensure proper credit is given to all sources referenced.
